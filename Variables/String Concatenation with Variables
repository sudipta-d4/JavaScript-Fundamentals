# Notes

In previous exercises, we assigned strings to variables. Now, letâ€™s go over how to connect, or concatenate, strings in variables.

The + operator can be used to combine two string values even if those values are being stored in variables:

let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.

In the example above, we assigned the value 'armadillo' to the myPet variable. On the second line, the + operator is used to combine three strings: 'I own a pet', the 
value saved to myPet, and '.'. We log the result of this concatenation to the console as:

I own a pet armadillo.

Instructions: 

Create a variable named favoriteAnimal and set it equal to your favorite animal.

let favoriteAnimal = "Sloth";

Use console.log() to print 'My favorite animal: ANIMAL' to the console. Use string concatenation so that ANIMAL is replaced with the value in your favoriteAnimal 
variable.

console.log("My favorite animal: " + favoriteAnimal);

Output:

My favorite animal: Sloth
