# Notes

While writing code, it can be useful to keep track of the data types of the variables in your program. If you need to check the data type of a variable’s value, you 
can use the typeof operator.

The typeof operator checks the value to its right and returns, or passes back, a string of the data type.

const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string
 
const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number
 
const unknown3 = true; 
console.log(typeof unknown3); // Output: boolean

Let’s break down the first example. Since the value unknown1 is 'foo', a string, typeof unknown1 will return 'string'.

Instructions:

Use console.log() to print the typeof newVariable.

let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.';
console.log(typeof newVariable);

Great, now let’s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below the console.log() statement, reassign newVariable to 1

newVariable = 1;

Since you assigned this new value to newVariable, it has a new type! On the line below your reassignment, use console.log() to print typeof newVariable again.

console.log(typeof newVariable);

Output:

string
number
