# JavaScript-Fundamentals on Codeacademy
In this course, I have undertaken programming fundamentals with JavaScript syntax. The concepts covered in this course lay the foundation for using JavaScript in any environment.

After this course, you will be able to:

- implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables
- use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript
- construct functions and pass data through them
- identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript
- use arrays to store lists of data
- use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times
- use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays
- use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items

# What will you create?

Throughout this course, I have been tasked with applying the concepts learned in projects. Here is a preview of some of the projects featured in this course:

- Kevin Weather: Build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing variables and printing to the console to create a temperature convertor.

- Sleep Debt Calculator: Build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing variables and printing to the console to create a temperature convertor.

- Whale Talk: Master the art of looping by creating a program that talks like a whale!
