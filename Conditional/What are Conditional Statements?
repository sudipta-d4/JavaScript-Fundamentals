# Notes

In life, we make decisions based on circumstances. Think of an everyday decision as mundane as falling asleep — if we are tired, we go to bed, otherwise, we wake up 
and start our day. These if-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating conditional statements. A conditional statement checks a specific condition(s) and 
performs a task based on the condition(s).

We’ll be covering the following concepts:

- if, else if, and else statements
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- truthy vs falsy values
- ternary operators
- switch statement
