1. If isHungry equals true, which of the following expressions evaluates to true?

isHungry !==false  because isHungry does not equal false.

2. What will the code block log to the console?

let groceryItem = "apple";
switch (groceryItem) {
  case "tomato":
    console.log("Tomatoes are $0.49");
    break;
  case "lime":
    console.log("Limes are $1.49");
    break;
  case "papaya":
    console.log("Papayas are $1.29");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid item");
    break;
}

invalid item because groceryItem = "apple", it does not match any of the cases, so the default block will run.

3. What will the following code log to the console?

let needTacos = true;
if (needTacos) {
    console.log("Finding tacos");
} else {
    console.log("Keep on keeping on!");
}

Finding tacos because needTacos is true, the first block will run.

4. Translate this to JavaScript: Log “Bear!” to console if isFurry is true and weight is over 100 pounds.

if (isFurry && weight > 100) {
  console.log("Bear!")
}

Because this only logs “Bear!” if isFurry is true and weight is greater than 100.

5. How would you properly refactor this code block using the ternary operator?

if (walkSignal === 'Walk') {
    console.log('You may walk!'); 
} else {   
    console.log('Do not walk!');
}

walkSignal ==='Walk' ? console.log('You may walk!') : console.log('Do not walk!') 

6. What will the code block log to the console?

let weather = "spring";
let clothingChoice = "";

if (weather === "spring") {
  clothingChoice = "Put on rain boots.";
} else if (weather === "summer") {
  clothingChoice = "Make sure to take your sunscreen.";
} else if (weather === "fall") {
  clothingChoice = "Wear a light jacket.";
} else if (weather === 'winter') {
  clothingChoice = "Wear a heavy coat.";
} else {
  console.log('Invalid weather type.');
};
console.log(clothingChoice);

Put on rain boots because the weather equals spring, clothingChoice is set to "Put on rain boots."

7. What will the code block log to the console?

let runTime = 35;
let runDistance = 3.5;
 
if (runTime <= 30 && runDistance > 3.5) {
  console.log("You're super fast!");
} else if (runTime >= 30 && runDistance <= 3) {
  console.log("You're not making your pace!");
} else if (runTime > 30 || runDistance > 3) {
  console.log("Nice workout!"); 
} else {
  console.log("Keep on running!");
}

Nice workout because the condition (runTime is greater than 30 OR runDistance is greater than 3) is true.

8. Which of the following variables contains a truthy value?

let varOne = 'false' because non-empty strings are truthy!

9. What is the general purpose of a conditional statement?
